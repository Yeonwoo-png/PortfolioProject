                <p class = "project_info">Despite being a front-end developer and a UX/UI designer, I dabbled a bit in making a game. It seemed really interesting and fun but the thing is that I have never drawn before so it was a challenge to try and make my character. This is what I made for my 2D platformer game and the first 2D sprite I have drawn so its special to me now. (P.S. This is Yeonwoo, don't worry, this is my own drawing I didn't steal this from someone on the internet)</p>

                <p class = "project_info">One memorable UX/UI project I have done was for Discord. It focused on improving server navigation, accessability, and engagement. Using Figma I made wireframes and prototypes, conducting user research to pinpoint the problems of the current UI. Afterwards, I used the feedback and tests to implemented a cleaner and more structured layout with improved accessibility. </p>

                <p class = "project_info">I worked on a front-end project for Google one time and it was an incredible opportunity to build a high performance web application integrated with Google. Using React.js I developed UI components to help with speed and efficiency. I also made sure the application run smoothly across multiple devices and refined the UI to Google's standards, ensuring a positive user experience. </p>
