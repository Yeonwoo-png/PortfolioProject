# PortfolioProject

My project consists of a nav bar at the top and the first thing you should see is the professional headshot with a brief introduction. Then the About Me section lists off a more detailed description about Emily and her skills to show off. Then towards the bottom are the projects in a row format with their descriptions being under them as well. For most of this project I used flexbox to space everything out and I used light colors because I thought it looked nice. I didn't use a normal white background because that genuinely hurts my eyes after a certain point and it would probably hurt other's eyes as well so I used a nicer shade of white. I made a separate page for the Contact and Resume because I didn't like the look of having everything cluttered towards the bottom of the page. The Contact page is separated into two halves using flexbox, on the right side it has the contact fields and on the left it has the title and little intro. The Resume page is just a simple page that has a title and a little excerpt before the resume pops up. The nav bar links to everywhere and the "About Me" and "Projects" button should automatically go directly to the Home page and to that specific section, even if you are on the "Contact" or "Resume" page it should still take you to those sections.
